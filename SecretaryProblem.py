    Problem. Each line contains between 25 and 100 data points, each a
    float between 0 and 100.  The idea is that these are the rankings
    of secretaries.  In the file each ranking has 3 digits of
    precision.  I originally made the rankings integers, but this led
    too often to duplicate rankings.  It's still possible, but
    unlikely, that two rankings could be identical.
